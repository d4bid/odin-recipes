    <p>This buchi recipe makes deep-fried glutinous rice flour balls filled with sweetened mung beans for a yummy Pinoy snack.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces green mung beans</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups glutinous rice flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 quart cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup water and mung beans in a pot and bring to a boil; cook over medium heat until beans are very tender, about 30 minutes. Mash beans thoroughly, then stir in 1/2 cup sugar until well combined; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix together rice flour, remaining 1/4 cup water, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a large bowl; knead just enough to form a ball. Divide dough into small pieces and roll into balls. Flatten each dough ball, then spoon 1 tablespoon mashed bean mixture into the middle of dough. Wrap dough around bean mixture and pinch edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry balls in batches in hot oil until golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes per batch. Drain on paper towels and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
